Define the MDP:

    Define the state space
    Define the action space
    Define the reward function
    Define the transition function

Initialize the environment:

    Set the current state to an initial state
    Draw the environment using Pygame (e.g., grid world, maze)

Implement the policy:

    Define the policy function that maps states to actions
    Use the policy to select an action at each time step

Implement the main loop:

    Repeat until a terminal state is reached:
        Get the current state
        Use the policy to select an action
        Update the state based on the transition function and the selected action
        Compute the reward based on the reward function and the new state
        Update the display using Pygame (e.g., move the player, update the score)
